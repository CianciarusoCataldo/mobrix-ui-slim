## MoBrix-ui philosophy

This library is built upon few (but important) concepts:

- Small library size, to not impact on final app bundle size
- Few dependencies, to not introduce a bunch of additional packages (that could also introduce bugs or version conflicts with pre-existent packages)
- Let the user customize every part as desired, but with default values set otherwise, to make every component ready to be used without so many parameters
- Every component should be integrable into every react app, so their behaviour must be customizable too (with callbacks, for example)

The same concepts are also the base of another project I maintain, [MoBrix-engine](https://github.com/CianciarusoCataldo/mobrix-engine) (check it out, it is also the base of [MoBrix-ui guide page](https://cianciarusocataldo.github.io/mobrix-ui/) !)
